class FeaturePipeline(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    Custom feature engineering transformer.
    
    This class inherits from:
    - BaseEstimator: This helps make the class compatible with scikit-learn's estimator API.
    - TransformerMixin: This provides the fit_transform method, which combines fit and transform.

    Purpose:
    - This helps in creating new features or modifying existing ones in the dataset.
    - It stops the risk of data leakage by ensuring that feature engineering is done within the pipeline.

    BaseEstimator: makes the class parameters easily accessible and allows for hyperparameter tuning.
    TransformerMixin: provides the fit_transform method for convenience.
